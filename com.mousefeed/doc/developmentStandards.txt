DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
Always do "The Right Thing".
Zero-tolerance policy for warnings and errors from development
and code validation tools.
Review the existing code in the com.mousefeed.client package to get a feel
of the approaches described in this document.

Test Driven Development. Strive for good tests, 100% test code coverage
(as practical). Remember, high test coverage does not mean good tests.
At the current stage Eclipse UI is not automatically tested. 

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
Code is being developed using Ecipse IDE with following code validation plugins:
* CheckSyle - uses the checkstyle.xml configuration file.
* FindBugs - turned on to maximum sensitivity.
* EclEmma - the plugin for Emma code coverage tool.
The configurations for these tools are checked in with the project.
The existing validations are not set in stone.
They are subject to discussion and change. 

BEFORE CHECKING IN
Rebuild the project, make sure there are no messages from the validation
tools described in the "Development Environment" section.
Make sure the "dist" target runs successfully. 

CODING CONVENTIONS
Are based on the standard Sun Java coding conventions.

All classes, methods except the private ones must have *full* Javadoc comments.
Methods should indicate whether null values are acceptable for the method
parameters, whether method can return null.
